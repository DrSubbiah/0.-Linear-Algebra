    "# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that is widely used in linear algebra, statistics, signal processing, and machine learning. It allows a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ to be decomposed into three matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = U \\Sigma V^T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $A$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix.\n",
    "- $U$ is an $m \\times m$ orthogonal matrix. The columns of $U$ are the **left singular vectors** of $A$.\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$ is an $m \\times n$ diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. These are the **singular values** of $A$, arranged in decreasing order.\n",
    "- $V^T$ is an $n \\times n$ orthogonal matrix. The rows of $V^T$ (or columns of $V$) are the **right singular vectors** of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of SVD:\n",
    "- The matrices $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, meaning:\n",
    "  - $U^T U = I_m$ (where $I_m$ is the identity matrix of size $m$),\n",
    "  - $V^T V = I_n$ (where $I_n$ is the identity matrix of size $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The singular values in $\\Sigma$ are non-negative and typically arranged in decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The singular value decomposition can be thought of as a way to orthogonally transform the matrix $A$ into a form where its action is separated into scaling along orthogonal directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Mathematical Treatment of SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Geometric Interpretation of SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Right Singular Vectors ($V$)**: These vectors define the directions of the axes in the input space where the transformation $A$ acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Singular Values ($\\Sigma$)**: These represent the scaling factors along these new axes. They indicate how much stretching or shrinking occurs in the direction of each right singular vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Left Singular Vectors ($U$)**: These vectors define the directions in the output space of the transformation $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Deriving SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the SVD for a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, we need to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices $A^T A$ and $A A^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find $A^T A$ and $AA^T$\n",
    "2. Compute the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of $A^T A$ and $AA^T$\n",
    "3. The square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of $A^T A$ are the singular values of $A$, which are placed on the diagonal of $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "4. Normalized eigenvectors of $A^T A$ form the columns of $V$\n",
    "5. Normalized eigenvectors of $AA^T$ form the columns of $U$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Singular Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal elements of $\\Sigma$, denoted $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_r$ (where $r = \\min(m, n)$), are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of $A^T A$ or $A A^T$. These values are typically arranged in decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Full SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full SVD, the matrices $U$ and $V$ are square and orthogonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $U$ is an $m \\times m$ orthogonal matrix.\n",
    "- $\\Sigma$ is an $m \\times n$ diagonal matrix (with zeros padding the non-square part).\n",
    "- $V^T$ is an $n \\times n$ orthogonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full SVD is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = U \\Sigma V^T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a $2 \\times 3$ matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the SVD as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute $A^T A$,$AA^T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^T A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $AA^T$, $A^T A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues of $AA^T$ are $2,1$ with eigen vectors: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues of $A^TA$ are $2,1,0$ with eigen vectors: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1\\end{bmatrix}$;   $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalized Eigen vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "For $AA^T$, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $A^TA$, $\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{bmatrix}$;   $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Form the matrix $U$, whose columns are normalized eigen vecgors of $AA^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Form the matrix $V$, whose columns are normalized eigen vecgors of $A^TA$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compute the positive square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of $A^TA$ to get the singular values for forming the matrix $\\Sigma$. Diagonal elements of $\\Sigma$ are the non-zerosingular values (2, 1). All other places are zero\n",
    "\n",
    "That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\Sigma=\\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Finally, construct the full SVD:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = U \\Sigma V^T $$\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1. A=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 0\\\\ 0 & -2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2. A=\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2\\\\ 2 & 3 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3. A=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3\\\\ 4 & 10 \\end{bmatrix}$$"
