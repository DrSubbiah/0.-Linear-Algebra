## Introduction to Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces (also called linear spaces), and linear transformations between these spaces. It provides the fundamental tools for dealing with linear equations, vector spaces, and matrix operations. In this lecture note series, we cover essential topics ranging from basic concepts of vectors and matrices to more advanced topics like eigenvalues and matrix decompositions.

## Vectors

### **Definition**
- A **vector** is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. It can be represented as a tuple of numbers, known as coordinates, in a particular space.

### **Operations**
- **Addition**: The sum of two vectors.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Scaling a vector by a constant.
- **Dot Product**: A scalar result from multiplying corresponding components of two vectors.
- **Cross Product**: For 3D vectors, the result is a vector perpendicular to both original vectors.

### **Norms**
- The **norm** (or length) of a vector measures its magnitude.
  - **L1 Norm**: Sum of the absolute values of the vector components.
  - **L2 Norm**: Square root of the sum of the squares of the components.

### **Orthogonal and Orthonormal Vectors**
- **Orthogonal Vectors**: Vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.
- **Orthonormal Vectors**: Vectors are orthonormal if they are orthogonal and each has unit length (norm = 1).

## Matrices

### **Definition and Notation**
- A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
  - A matrix $A$ of size $m \times n$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, denoted as $A = [a_{ij}]$ where $a_{ij}$ is the element at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.

### **Operations**
- **Addition**: Matrices of the same size can be added element-wise.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: The dot product of rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.
- **Transpose**: Flipping the matrix over its diagonal.

### **Types of Matrices**
- **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix with non-zero elements only on the diagonal.
- **Scalar Matrix**: A diagonal matrix where all diagonal elements are equal.
- **Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix equal to its transpose ($A = A^T$).
- **Skew-Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix where $A = -A^T$.
- **Identity Matrix**: A square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### **Definition**
- An **eigenvalue** $\lambda$ and its corresponding **eigenvector** $\mathbf{v}$ satisfy the equation:
  $$
  A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
  $$
  where $A$ is a square matrix.

### **Calculation**
- Eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation: 
  $$
  \text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0
  $$

### **Diagonalization**
- A matrix $A$ is **diagonalizable** if it can be written as:
  $$
  A = P D P^{-1}
  $$
  where $P$ is a matrix of eigenvectors and $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

## Gradient, Jacobians, and Hessians

### **Gradient**
- The **gradient** of a scalar function $f(\mathbf{x})$ is the vector of partial derivatives:
  $$
  \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right]^T
  $$

### **Jacobian**
- The **Jacobian matrix** is a generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions, representing all first-order partial derivatives.

### **Hessian**
- The **Hessian matrix** is the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives, representing the curvature of a function.

## First and Second-Order Approximation (Newton's Method)

### **First-Order Approximation**
- The first-order approximation is a **linear approximation** based on the gradient, used to estimate the value of a function near a given point.

### **Second-Order Approximation (Newton's Method)**
- The second-order approximation uses both the gradient and Hessian matrix to more accurately approximate the function near a given point, enabling faster convergence in optimization.

## Transformations in Linear Algebra

### **Linear Transformations**
- A **linear transformation** is a function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.

### **Change of Basis**
- **Change of basis** involves representing a vector in a different coordinate system or basis. It is important for understanding how transformations behave across different bases.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### **Overview of SVD**
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** is a factorization of a matrix $A$ into three matrices: 
  $$
  A = U \Sigma V^T
  $$
  where:
  - $U$ is an orthogonal matrix containing left singular vectors,
  - $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with singular values,
  - $V$ is an orthogonal matrix containing right singular vectors.

### **Applications of SVD**
- SVD is widely used in data compression, noise reduction, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
