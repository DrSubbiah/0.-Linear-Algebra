## Introduction to Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that focuses on vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations. This field provides essential tools for solving linear equations, understanding vector spaces, and performing matrix operations. The lecture notes series in this repository covers both fundamental and advanced topics in Linear Algebra, aiming to build a solid understanding of these concepts.

## Vectors

- **Definition**: Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They can be represented as ordered lists of numbers, known as coordinates.
- **Operations**: Vectors can be added, scaled (multiplied by a scalar), and undergo operations like dot and cross products.
- **Norms**: The norm of a vector measures its magnitude. The L1 norm is the sum of the absolute values of the components, while the L2 norm is the square root of the sum of squared components.
- **Orthogonal and Orthonormal Vectors**: Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular to each other, while orthonormal vectors are both orthogonal and of unit length.

## Matrices

- **Definition and Notation**: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It is a powerful tool for representing and solving systems of linear equations.
- **Operations**: Matrices can be added, multiplied, and transposed. Scalar multiplication scales the elements of a matrix by a constant.
- **Types of Matrices**:
  - **Diagonal Matrix**: A square matrix where non-diagonal elements are zero.
  - **Scalar Matrix**: A diagonal matrix where all diagonal elements are equal.
  - **Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix equal to its transpose.
  - **Skew-Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix whose transpose is its negative.
  - **Identity Matrix**: A square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **Definition**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are key to understanding the behavior of linear transformations. An eigenvalue is a scalar that indicates how much the eigenvector is scaled during the transformation.
- **Calculation**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed using the characteristic equation, and they help in matrix diagonalization.
- **Diagonalization**: Some matrices can be diagonalized, which simplifies many operations, especially matrix exponentiation.

## Gradient, Jacobians, and Hessians

- **Gradient**: The gradient of a function gives the direction of the steepest ascent at a point, and it is represented as a vector of partial derivatives.
- **Jacobian**: The Jacobian matrix generalizes the gradient to vector-valued functions, representing all the first-order partial derivatives.
- **Hessian**: The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives, representing the curvature of a function and providing insight into its optimization behavior.

## First and Second Order Approximation (Newton's Method)

- **First-Order Approximation**: This linear approximation uses the gradient of a function to estimate its value near a given point.
- **Second-Order Approximation**: Newtonâ€™s method is a more accurate approach that uses both the gradient and the Hessian matrix for faster convergence in optimization problems.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

- **Overview**: SVD is a powerful matrix decomposition technique that factorizes a matrix into three matrices. It is widely used for dimensionality reduction, signal processing, and data compression.
- **Applications**: SVD is fundamental in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is used in machine learning for data reduction and feature extraction.
