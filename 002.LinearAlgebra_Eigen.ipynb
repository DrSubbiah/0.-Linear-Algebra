    "### Step-by-Step Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute the Characteristic Equation**:\n",
    "   - The characteristic equation of a matrix $A$ is given by:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{det}(A - \\lambda I_n) = 0\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where $I_n$ is the identity matrix of size $n \\times n$ and $\\lambda$ is a scalar. This equation is a polynomial in $\\lambda$ (called the **characteristic polynomial**).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solve the Characteristic Equation**:\n",
    "   - Solve the characteristic equation $\\text{det}(A - \\lambda I_n) = 0$ for $\\lambda$ to find the eigenvalues.\n",
    "   - The solutions to this equation are the **eigenvalues** of the matrix $A$. These eigenvalues can be real or complex numbers.\n",
    "   - If there are **repeated eigenvalues** (i.e., multiple solutions for the same $\\lambda$), they are called **degenerate eigenvalues**. This means the matrix has multiple eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Remark**: If an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ has multiplicity greater than 1, it is called a **repeated eigenvalue**. In such cases, the matrix may have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to this eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find Eigenvectors for Each Eigenvalue**:\n",
    "   - For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, substitute $\\lambda_i$ into the equation:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   (A - \\lambda_i I_n) \\cdot v = 0\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - This is a system of linear equations. Solve this system to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to $\\lambda_i$. The eigenvector is any non-zero solution to this system.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Normalize the Eigenvectors (Optional)**:\n",
    "   - Eigenvectors are typically normalized so that their length (or norm) is 1. This step is optional but often done for convenience in certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat for All Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "   - Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all distinct eigenvalues obtained from the characteristic equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks:\n",
    "- **Repeated Eigenvalues**: If an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ has multiplicity greater than 1 (i.e., it appears more than once as a solution to the characteristic equation), then there may be multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n",
    "- If the number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue, the matrix is **diagonalizable**.\n",
    "- If the number of linearly independent eigenvectors is less than the multiplicity of the eigenvalue, the matrix is **not diagonalizable**.\n",
